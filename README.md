# Precision-recall-curve-plotter

# Description:
The Precision-Recall (PR) curve is a useful evaluation metric, especially for imbalanced binary classification problems. It helps visualize the trade-off between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (true positive rate). In this project, we'll train a logistic regression model and plot its PR curve using the Iris dataset (binary version).

# âœ… What This Project Shows:
* Calculates precision-recall pairs for different thresholds

* Plots the PR curve and average precision (AP) score

* Shows how well a model identifies positives without too many false alarms
